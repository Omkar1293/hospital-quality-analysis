Hospital Quality Analysis
This project provides a comprehensive analysis of hospital quality metrics, such as patient satisfaction, readmission rates, mortality rates, and average treatment costs. It identifies key trends, relationships between variables, and top-performing hospitals based on specific criteria.

Features
Data Preprocessing: Cleans and organizes hospital data for analysis.
Statistical Analysis:
Summary statistics for hospital quality metrics.
Identification of top-performing hospitals.
Visualizations:
Distribution of patient satisfaction scores.
Relationships between readmission rates, mortality rates, and treatment costs.
Trends between patient satisfaction and treatment costs.
Custom Filtering: Filters hospitals based on predefined thresholds for performance.
Prerequisites
Software
R: Ensure R is installed on your system.
RStudio (optional): Recommended for interactive execution and visualizations.
R Libraries
Install the following R libraries before running the script:

R
Copy code
install.packages(c("tidyverse", "ggplot2", "dplyr"))
Project Files
hospital_quality_analysis.R: The R script containing the complete analysis workflow.
README.md: Documentation for the project (this file).
How to Run
Clone the Repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/hospital-quality-analysis.git
Open and Run the Script:
Open hospital_quality_analysis.R in R or RStudio.
Run the script step-by-step or all at once to analyze the data.
Analyze the Results:
View the generated summary statistics, visualizations, and top-performing hospital lists.
Sample Outputs
Summary Statistics
Displays key metrics such as average patient satisfaction, readmission rate, mortality rate, and treatment cost.

Visualizations
Patient Satisfaction Distribution: A histogram showing the distribution of satisfaction scores across hospitals.

Readmission vs. Mortality Rates: A scatter plot illustrating the relationship between readmission and mortality rates.

Treatment Cost vs. Patient Satisfaction: A scatter plot showing the relationship between treatment cost and satisfaction scores with a trend line.

Top Hospitals
Filters hospitals with:

Patient Satisfaction > 85
Readmission Rate < 10%
Mortality Rate < 5%
Example Dataset (Simulated)
The project includes a simulated dataset with the following variables:

HospitalID: Unique identifier for each hospital.
PatientSatisfaction: Satisfaction score (0â€“100).
ReadmissionRate: Percentage of patients readmitted within 30 days.
MortalityRate: Percentage of patients who passed away during treatment.
AverageTreatmentCost: Average cost of treatment (in USD).
Customization
Replace the simulated dataset with real hospital quality data for your analysis.
Adjust thresholds for identifying top-performing hospitals.
